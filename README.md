## Synopsis

After completing this course, you'll have a very good understanding of MATLAB programming language.

The lectures are prepared in a problem-solving manner. For example, a particular topic like vectorization or broadcasting was explained as simply as possible. Then how to apply those concepts in solving real problems was demonstrated.

## Note

* Try to solve the problems by yourself first. If you cannot, only then look at the solutions given. This will improve your skills and critical thinking.

* The course content was updated in 2023. The original 5 week lectures were later extended into 11 weeks.
