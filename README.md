## Synopsis

After completing this course, you'll have a very good understanding of MATLAB programming language.

The lectures are prepared in a problem-solving manner. For example, a particular topic like vectorization or broadcasting was explained as simply as possible. Then how to apply those concepts in solving real problems was demonstrated.

# Cody

Cody is an online MATLAB programming competition platform created by MathWorks.  Thousands of programmers around the world participate in this platform. More than 5000 programming challenges are available here and it's a good place to hone your MATLAB programming skill.

I personally love this platform and have solved around 3000 problems there. I also created around 200 new problems there as well as 5  problem groups. My highest ranking in Cody was 4th with 60 badges.

## Note

* Try to solve the problems by yourself first. If you cannot, only then look at the solutions given. This will improve your skills and critical thinking.

* Solutions to the assignment questions as well as mock test questions are provided. Try them by yourself first.

* The course content was updated in 2023. The original 5 week lectures were later extended into 11 weeks.
